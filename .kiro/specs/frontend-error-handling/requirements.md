# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical frontend issues affecting user experience in the Matrix chat application, including performance violations, network error handling, authentication flow problems, and Matrix client initialization failures. The goal is to create a robust, performant frontend that gracefully handles errors and provides clear feedback to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load smoothly without performance warnings, so that I have a responsive chat experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL eliminate all non-passive event listener violations
2. WHEN scroll events occur THEN the system SHALL use passive event listeners to maintain 60fps performance
3. WHEN the sidebar renders THEN the system SHALL not block the main thread with scroll event handlers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when network services are unavailable, so that I understand why certain features may not work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN APM monitoring services fail to connect THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without affecting core functionality
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with core features intact

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable authentication that doesn't get stuck in redirect loops, so that I can access the chat consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state is checked THEN the system SHALL prevent infinite redirect loops
2. WHEN login information exists THEN the system SHALL validate it before proceeding to chat
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL clear invalid tokens and redirect to login
4. WHEN route guards execute THEN the system SHALL have consistent timing and state checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Matrix client to initialize properly, so that I can see and interact with my chat rooms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the Matrix client SHALL initialize successfully with stored credentials
2. WHEN Matrix initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
3. WHEN room data is missing THEN the system SHALL attempt to reload from the server
4. WHEN the refresh button is clicked THEN the system SHALL only execute if the Matrix client is properly initialized

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error logging and monitoring, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them with sufficient context for debugging
2. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL capture stack traces and component state
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL log request details and response status
4. WHEN Matrix operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the specific operation and error details
